			  <h2>Meet OpenStreetMap, the biggest open data community in the world</h2>
				<p>ConMapas brings together the Latin American <a href="http://www.openstreetmap.org">OpenStreetMap</a> community, urban planners, geographers, artists, government and private sector around building open maps for better cities, development, disaster response, transit planning and business.</p>
				
				<p>Its purpose is to strengthen the community of mappers, generate knowledge and share tools to audiences with less experience in the field.
				Businesses, social organizations, students, government officials and anyone who can benefit from using mapping skills will participate in this meeting.</p>
				
				<p>In only one day, there will be workshops for beginners, a showcase of best regional projects, real-time mapping of Mexico City and open discussions. Whether you're already involved in OpenStreetMap or you'd simply like to learn more - come out and connect with likeminded people over creating the best map in the world and putting it to good use.</p>
				
				<p>OpenStreetMap is a free and open map of the world, created by a huge and growing global community of people just like you. Unlike other maps, the data in OpenStreetMap is free and open for anyone to use. ConMapas is taking place in the run up to the annual international OpenStreetMap conference which is taking place in Latin America this year: State of the Map in Buenos Aires from November 7 to 9.</p>
				<h2>Program</h2>
				<h3>Morning</h3>
				<p>Come out for a series of fast paced sessions and lightning talks taking a 360 degree view on OpenStreetMap with a focus on Latin America, learn about how you can use OpenStreetMap for your own purposes and participate in a discussion on how to grow OpenStreetMap in the future. Our speakers come from a diverse set of backgrounds, including non profits, government, businesses, technologists, community organizers and entrepreneurs, many of them building OpenStreetMap community personally in their respective countries.</p>
