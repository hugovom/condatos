<p>How do we design Open Government initiatives to enable institutional participation and integration, while balancing conflicting interests between citizens and government in the process? What are the opportunities and limitations of user-centered design in addressing these questions, and what are other relevant approaches? How do we structure and sequence various stages of design and implementation in response to the political complexities inherent in the public sector? This session will seek to explore these questions through concrete examples of Open Data and Open Government initiatives from across the region.</p>
